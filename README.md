# COVID-19-Dataset

Contain informative data related to COVID-19 pandemic. Specially, figure out about the First Case and First Death information for every single country. The datasets mainly focus on two major fields first one is First Case which consists of information of Date of First Case(s), Number of confirm Case(s) at First Day, Age of the patient(s) of First Case, Last Visited Country and the other one First Death information consist of Date of First Death and Age of the Patient who died first for every Country mentioning corresponding Continent.  The datasets also contain the Binary Matrix of spread chain among different country and region. 

*This is not a country. This is a ship. The name of the Cruise Ship was not given from the government.								
"N+":  the age is not specified but greater than N								
“No Trace”:  some data was not found 								
“Unspecified”: not available from the authority								
“N/A”: for “Last Visited Country(s) of Confirmed Case(s)” column, “N/A” indicates that the confirmed case(s) of those countries do not have any travel history in recent past; in “Age of First Death(s)” column “N/A” indicates that those countries do not have may death case till May 16, 2020.

## Abstract

The article represents coronavirus spread log history. The duration, coronavirus takes to spread from one country to another country, could be seen in this dataset and could predicted the same for future pandemics through this dataset. It is highly dependent on the cabalistic number of variables that is the main navel of these datasets. Information for this dataset is collected from trusted websites, local and international popular newspapers. This coronavirus dataset not only help to track the spreading route of coronavirus but also can be used for predicting the possible spreading route of similar future pandemics. This dataset consists of 186 countries' useful data related to COVID-19 pandemic from November 17, 2019, to May 16, 2020, with 8 unique variables that provide the information of the nature of the spread of COVID-19. The datasets mainly focus on two major fields, first one is First Case which consists of information of Date of First Case(s), Number of confirm Case(s) at First Day, Age of the patient(s) of First Case, Last Visited Country and the other one First Death information consist of Date of First Death and Age of the Patient who died first for every Country mentioning corresponding Continent.This dataset also can perform a bunch of predictions using Machine Learning applications, like -how fast the virus is spreading, affect rate, death rate, death rate and able to represent comparison between other pandemics. Using this dataset, any similar pandemic spreadness could be predicted earlier and necessary precaution measures could be taken.
